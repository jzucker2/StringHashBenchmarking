# StringHashBenchmarking

Things to test:
* Does NSData have efficient hashing?
* Does NSString have efficient hashing?
* Find other algorithms for hashing

Resources:
* [NSString hash method is inconsistent](https://coderwall.com/p/gcwpua/beware-of-nsstring-hash)
* Example of [NSString hash](http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/4775-nsstring-hash-method.html)
* Is [NSString hash computed every time?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/856764/is-nsstring-hash-computed-every-time)
* [MD5 vs SHA1 hashing](http://www.makebetterthings.com/iphone/how-to-get-md5-and-sha1-in-objective-c-ios-sdk/)
* [Fast, custom Objective-C hashing](https://www.cocoanetics.com/2013/02/fast-hashing/)
